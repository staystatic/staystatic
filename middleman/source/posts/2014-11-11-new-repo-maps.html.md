title: "beer.db - New Repo /maps - Free 'Full-Screen' Interactive Beer Maps w/ Brewery Listings"
---

The beer.db project - offering free public domain beer, brewery and brewpubs data - added a new repo, that is, `/maps` 
for hosting 'full-screen' interactive beer maps with brewery listings.

See an example [beer map for Austria](http://openbeer.github.io/maps/at) (~200 breweries n brewpubs)
live or [check the source](https://github.com/openbeer/maps) using the mapbox.js mapping library.
